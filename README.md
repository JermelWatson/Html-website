* Project Plan
For our Fall 2020 Intro to web development group project we have decided to create a website called Sports Stop. 
We chose to create a sports focused webpage in order to highlight the many sporting activities that one can enjoy in their leisure time. 
This website will host a variety of sports contents. Individuals will be able to browse sports news, sports facts, upcoming seasons, 
sessions league stats, Rising stars blog, fantasy draft, and calendar. This website will include a home page and six other main pages. 
The members of development team are Marckenly Estima, Mosunlade Ishola, Allan Muir and Jermel Watson. In addition, there will be four pages focused 
on a single sport namely volleyball, basketball, esports and track and field. Each page will be designed by a group member and presented in their own style and vision. 
The target audience that we are hoping to reach are children, young adults, seniors and elders. There is something for all sports lovers, and even someone is not 
particularly a sport lover they are still welcomed to our website. Since our website focuses on a selected nuber of sports our audience may be limited to fans of those 
sports in particular. Our mission is to provide a space where sports lover can come together in times of need and watch sports in a wide variety. 
To participate in fantasy leagues and meet other sports fans. The main colors of our home page will be red and gray. It will include our personalized logo in red at 
the top left-hand corner and bottom left-hand corner. The header will contain our website banner and our slogan.*
