				<p>
					<em>
						It was a weird year for League of Legends. China's LoL Pro League was one of the first major esports (and sports as a whole) to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
						It was the first to be shut down and subsequently the first to reopen.
						Leagues all around the world went on a wave of hiatuses, crowdless matches and online play, depending on which region a team played in.
					</em>
				</p>

				<p>
					<em>
						DAMWON were heavily favored going into this match, and unlike last year's worlds finals,
						which was expected to be much closer than the 3-0 FunPlus Phoenix victory, the 2020 championship series
						played out about as expected.

				<p><b>Microsoft's Phil Spencer on Xbox's new approach to gaming...</b></p>
				<br />
				<p>
					<em>
						As we approach a brand new generation of consoles, <i>
							(with Sony passing the baton from the PS4 to the PS5, and Microsoft
							succeeding the Xbox One with the Xbox Series X and Series S),
						</i> Microsoft executive vice-president of Gaming
						Phil Spencer insists that the paradigm to look at this console generation is by how many people are playing video games,
						not a head-to-head comparison of console sales.
						The Series X/S are but a piece of the Microsoft offering,
						with a complete gaming approach across multiple devices,
						spearheaded by Microsoft Game Pass.
