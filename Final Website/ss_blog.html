  <h5><p>The ESL Pro League and Flashpoint are the two major franchised Counter-Strike: Global Offensive leagues

	<h3>ESL Pro League</h3>
	<h5><p>In February 2020, ESL and 13 teams signed the "Louvre Agreement," which entitled each member team to 
	permanent participation in the ESL Pro League and entitled new partner teams beginning in the 11th season of 
	the ESL Pro League to additional compensation and governing rights for the first time. They nominated a 
	seven-person board including ESL and team representatives and an elected commissioner and entitled those teams 
	to revenue and profit sharing in the ESL Pro League and ESL Pro Tour events. The league also established, 
	alongside the Counter-Strike Professional Players' Association, a player council that will act as the voice on 
	behalf of the players participating in the ESL Pro League. The Louvre Agreement allows for up to 16 partner 
	teams, although only 13 signed up for the first season. Season 11 is taking place online due to the coronavirus.</p></h5>

  but there were still plenty of deals done, and you can check out the major ones here.
  The window might be closed across the top leagues in Europe, but here are the best rumours from around the globe.
  
  Arsenal are ready to sell Nicolas Pepe after his underwhelming performances in

  <h4>latest News: Nov 28, 2020</h4>
 
  
  <h5><p>This class of NBA rookies is facing an unprecedented transition to the league. 
  Most of them haven't played an organized game since March, and now they are set to begin 
  their first NBA training camp on Dec. 1, less than two weeks after being drafted.

 The ongoing coronavirus pandemic deprived them of the opportunity to walk across the stage and shake
 the commissioner's hand on draft night, and prevented them from having any kind of summer league or 
 extended offseason to get ready for their first NBA season.</p></h5>

	<h2><p>Diamond League track and field series plans 14 meets after limited events this year</p></a></h2>
  
  <h4>latest News: Nov 24, 2020</h4>
 
  
  <h5><p>MONACO -- The Diamond League track and field series will visit 14 cities in 2021 to rebound after the coronavirus pandemic limited the traditional meets this year.

Organizers said Tuesday the series is scheduled to start on May 23 in Rabat, Morocco, take a one-month break for the postponed Tokyo Olympics, and end with a Sept. 8-9 meet in Zurich.

"The calendar is strictly provisional at this stage and remains subject to changes depending on the global health situation in 2021,'' organizers said in a statement.

A meet July 13 in London would be the last Diamond League stop before Olympic track events in Tokyo. The first post-Olympics meet is scheduled for Aug. 14 in Shanghai. A second meet in China is scheduled for Aug. 22 at a venue to be confirmed.

The only meet in North America is set for Aug. 21 in Eugene, Oregon, at the revamped Hayward Field -- the host of next world championships in 2022.</p></h5>
